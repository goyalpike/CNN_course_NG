# CNN\_course_NG
This repository contains exercises problems given in the course by Prof. Andrew Ng on [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/). I first would like to express my sincere thanks to Prof. Andrew Ng for providing such a series of courses on deeplearning.ai. I have learned a lot from [this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning) and I strongly recommend whoever wish to get started with a convolutional neural network.  

This repository contains CNN exercises from the course mentioned above. Most of the parts are from the course, and I have modified according to my needs. Feel free to play with the codes and modify them according to your needs. 

There are several examples from the course (instead used Keras implementation as a high-level API for tensorflow)

1. In the first example, we build a convolution neural network that identifies the handsign digits.
2. In the second example, we construction of a convolution neural network that can tell if a person in a picture is happy or unhappy.
3. In the third example, we work on the fundamental of a ResNet which is known to be a powerful architecture for learning a deep network by alleviating the gradient vanishing problem.
4. In the forth example, we implement Neural Transfer Style algorithm, meaning transform an image in a given Style.

## Google Colab
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/ is a plateform provided by Google to use free GPU. However, there is a [Google Colab Pro](https://colab.research.google.com/signup) version too, where more funcationality is provided. 

In this repo, all the scripts are run on the Google Colab. It is prefered to run in GPU for speed-up; on a CPU, they would be very slow.

Thank you, Prof. Andrew Ng, for giving great courses on machine/deep learning! You are awesome! Keep inspiring us.
