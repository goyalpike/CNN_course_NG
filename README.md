# CNN\_course_NG
This repository contains exercises problems given in the course by Prof. Andrew Ng on [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/). I first would like to express my sincere thanks to Prof. Andrew Ng for providing such a series of courses on deeplearning.ai. I have learned a lot from [this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning) and I strongly recommend whoever wish to get started with a convolutional neural network.  

This repository contains CNN exercises from the course mentioned above. Most of the parts are from the course, and I have modified according to my needs. Feel free to play with the codes and modify them according to your needs. 

There are mainly three examples now:

1. In the first example, we build a convolution neural network that identifies the handsign digits.
2. In the second example, we construction of a convolution neural network that can tell if a person in a picture is happy or unhappy.
3. IN the third example, we work on the fundamental of a ResNet which is known to be a powerful architecture for learning a deep network by alleviating the gradient vanishing problem.


Thank you, Prof. Andrew Ng, for giving great courses on machine/deep learning! You are awesome! Keep inspiring us.
